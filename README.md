# Natural Language Processing

`In progress...`

This is a repo for collecting projects that involve NLP. Each finished project will have their own repo and GitHub page with a presentation linked to the portfolio page.

- **Text Analytics With R**

To a certain extent, this project emulates, but also builds upon [Data Science Dojo's](https://datasciencedojo.com/) free YouTube tutorial by David Langer: [Introduction To Text Analytics With R](https://github.com/BigBangData/IntroToTextAnalyticsWithR) tutorials. Instead of using R, however, I translated it to Python.

The finished project will not be a step-by-step tutorial - there are plenty of those online. Rather, I'm hoping for it to be a framework for classification with open text format that can be repurposed for different NLP goals. This project's data focus is the [SMS Spam Collection](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/) created by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, which can be found in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection#)

- **Email SPAM detector**

This project builds upon the first, reapplying the same framework. The purpose is to see whether the previous classifier framework was generalizable to a similar problem area.

- **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** 

This third project builds upon the first two by applying the same framework to a tangential problem, predicting the polarity of a Tweet.
