# Natural Language Processing

`In progress...`

This is a repository for collecting projects that involve NLP. Each finished project will have their own repository and GitHub page with a presentation linked to the portfolio page.

- **SMS Spam Classifier**

The project is now hosted and explained in the [SMS Spam Detect](https://github.com/BigBangData/SMS_SpamDetect) repository and the app is deployed [here](https://spam-detect42.herokuapp.com/).


- **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** 

This project builds upon the first by applying the same framework to a tangential problem, predicting the polarity of a Tweet.
