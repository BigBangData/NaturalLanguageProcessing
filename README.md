# Natural Language Processing

`In progress...`

This is a repo for collecting projects that involve NLP. Each finished project will have their own repo and GitHub page with a presentation linked to the portfolio page.

- **TextAnalyticsWithR**: 

This project emulates and builds upon the Data Science Dojo's [Introduction To Text Analytics With R](https://github.com/BigBangData/IntroToTextAnalyticsWithR) tutorials, but using Python instead.

The finished project will not be a step-by-step tutorial - there are plenty of those online. Rather, it will be a framework for binary classification with open text format that can be repurposed for different NLP goals. In this case, an SMS spam detector.

- **Email SPAM detector**:

This project builds upon the first, reapplying the same framework. The purpose is to see whether the previous classifier framework was generalizable to a similar problem area.

- **TwitterSentimentAnalysis**: 

This third project builds upon the first two by applying the same framework to a tangential problem, predicting the polarity of a Tweet.
