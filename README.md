Twitter Sentiment Analysis
======================
    
TODO: 
    
    - README.md should be the presentation
    - Organize projects: too many goals (Sentiment Analysis, test QWERTY Effect, TF-IDF guide)
    
NEXT TODO:

    - Restructured entire project: follow IntroToTextAnalytics workflow
    - split train/test data while raw
    - then cleanup
    - then pre-process
    - careful with IDF calculation (cache IDF)
    - calculate SVD
    - etc.
