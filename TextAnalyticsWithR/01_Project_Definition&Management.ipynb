    "1. define the problem, set expectations, include evaluation criteria\n",
    "2. preliminary and minimal EDA and pre-splitting cleanup\n",

    "4. create a cleanup and preprocessing pipeline for the training data that can be re-applied to the test data\n",
    "5. train a couple baseline models to ensure process is smooth and pre-processing is dialed in\n",
    "6. using cross-validation, evaluate a variety models without hyperparameter tuning to establish some baselines\n",
    "7. short-list promising models for further hyperparemeter tuning\n",
    "8. iterate on any phase of the project as needed\n",
    "9. consider feature selection and feature engineering (this can be done earlier)\n",
    "10. decide on a final cleanup and processing pipeline\n",
    "11. settle on a final model\n",
    "12. re-apply all cleanup and processing steps to the test set and evaluate final model - once\n",
