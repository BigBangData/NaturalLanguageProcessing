    "    * so far accuracies are lowe\n",
    "    * this just introduces more complexity - stop\n",

    "#### Current Status\n",
    "\n",
    "- Added bigrams:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Perform LSA: 06_Cleanup_LSA_dev\n",
    "- Feature Engineering: add textlength, counts, consine similarity\n",
    "- Finalize cleanup pipeline, dev version and implementation\n",
    "- Start modeling again\n",

    "- Bag-of-Ngrams\n",
    "- LSA+SVD\n",
    "- Boosting\n",
    "- SVC\n",
    "- Ensembles\n",
